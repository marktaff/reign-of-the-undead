# Depends on: being run from the mods/rotudev folder

# Suppress output by redirecting to /dev/null if needed, but here we'll just run commands
# Ensure the correct current working directory gets set
cd "$(dirname "$0")"/../../

# Launch the Listen server
#   In a listen server, the COD4 client and server run in the same process, which makes
#   it the easiest to set up.  The downside is that there can be only one player, and
#   you can't change maps.  When the game ends, the process ends.  I always use a listen
#   server for testing code changes and for editing maps with the UMI Map Editor.
#
#   fs_game sets the name of the mod run
#   sv_punkbuster must be 0 for zombies to appear!
#   developer and developer_script should be 0 for regular games, but must be 1 to use the UMI Editor
#   exec server.cfg loads all of the various *.cfg files
#   devmap sets the name of the map to load when the server starts
